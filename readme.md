# A very simple game in python
It has been created to be used in a training and is full of bugs. It is still
useful to learn programming and going through the code to understand what it
does.

It has been decided to keep things like enemies, power ups and other things
out of scope since it wouldn`t be feasible to cover it during the training time
frame.

# Running it
Have python installed (3.7+).

Install pipenv:
```
pip install pipenv
```

Clone it somewhere and run the following commands at the project folder:
```
pipenv install
pipenv run python main.py
```
